                                            <p><em>Lions & Tigers</em> is the story of South Sudan's Wheelchair basketball team.</p>
                                            <p>Filmed in South Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia, it tells the heroic story of a group of courageous and inspiring young men determined to overcome all odds to follow their dreams.</p>
                                            <p>The players have overcome challenges that most of us cannot imagine. Many lost limbs to landmine and gunshot injuries while fighting as child soldiers in Sudan’s civil war. Airlifted by the Red Cross to a refugee camp in Kenya, it was here where they first started to play wheelchair basketball.</p>
                                            <p>South Sudan became the world’s newest nation in July 2011 and the exiled wheelchair basketballers returned to their homeland to fulfil their dream of forming a national team. But before long, war broke out in their young nation and many of the players became refugees once more.</p>
                                            <p>Despite all this they have never lost hope. Some of the team still practice in Juba, while others dream of returning to join their teammates. All of them hope that one day they can lead their young nation to Olympic glory.</p>
                                            <p>We have been filming the journey of this group of courageous and determined men for the past five years. Production is ongoing.</p>

                                            <p>Shot in 2013, <em>The Second Crisis</em> is a short documentary revealing the story of the devastating impact that the Syrian refugee crisis had on the most vulnerable people in Jordan.</p>
                                            <p>More than a million Syrian refugees have arrived in Jordan, a country of just 6.5 million. Rents have tripled, food prices are rising, water and electricity are becoming increasingly scarce. Many Jordanians can no longer afford to support their families and face eviction from their homes. This is their story.</p>
                                            <p>The film, which was partly crowd funded, had screenings in the UK and the US.</p>
